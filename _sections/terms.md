**Sprint cycles:** A "timeboxed" effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The duration is fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, although two weeks is typical. _(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint))_

**Stand-ups:** A meeting with attendees typically standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods helps to keep the meetings short. The meetings are usually timeboxed to 5–15 minutes and are held standing up to remind people to keep the meeting short and to-the-point. There are three questions to ask and answer in the daily stand-up ("What did I accomplish yesterday?" / "What will I do today?" / "What obstacles are impeding my progress?") _(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective#Software_development))_ _(See also: [Features of agile](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques#daily-standup))_

**User stories:** One or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function. _(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story))_ _(See also: [Writing user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html), [5 ways to help user research work better in agile](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/05/29/5-ways-to-help-user-research-work-better-in-agile/))_
